        "Provide a comprehensive tutorial on Python programming, starting with an introduction to Python and Google Colab. The tutorial will cover Python fundamentals including variables, data types, operators, conditional statements, loops, and core data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. It will also introduce functions, basic input/output, error handling with try-except blocks, and the use of modules and packages. Finally, the tutorial will culminate in a mini-project applying these concepts and conclude with next steps and resources for continued learning."

        "### Functions: Organizing Your Code\n",
        "\n",
        "**Functions** are self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are fundamental for writing clean, efficient, and maintainable Python programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Importance of Functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Code Reusability**: Once a function is defined, it can be called multiple times throughout your program (or even in different programs), avoiding redundant code. This adheres to the \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" (DRY) principle.\n",
        "2.  **Organization and Readability**: Functions break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces, making your code easier to understand, debug, and maintain.\n",
        "3.  **Modularity**: Functions promote modular programming, where different parts of your code are independent and can be developed and tested separately.\n",
        "4.  **Abstraction**: Functions allow you to hide the complex details of an operation behind a simple name, letting you focus on *what* the function does rather than *how* it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Defining Functions (`def` keyword):\n",
        "\n",
        "Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, a set of parentheses `()` which may contain parameters, and a colon `:`. The code block that makes up the function's body is indented.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...):\n",
        "    # Function body (indented code)\n",
        "    # Perform some operations\n",
        "    # return a_value # Optional: return a value\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Passing Arguments:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Arguments** are values passed into a function's parameters when the function is called. They allow functions to operate on different data each time they are invoked.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Returning Values:\n",
        "\n",
        "The `return` statement is used to send a value back from the function to the caller. If a function does not have an explicit `return` statement, it implicitly returns `None`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Basic Concepts of Scope:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scope** refers to the region of a program where a variable is accessible. In Python, variables defined inside a function have **local scope**, meaning they can only be accessed from within that function. Variables defined outside any function have **global scope** and can be accessed from anywhere in the program, including inside functions (though modifying them directly from within a function requires the `global` keyword, which we'll not cover in depth here).\n",

        "### Modules and Packages\n",
        "\n",
        "As your Python programs grow in size and complexity, it becomes essential to organize your code to keep it manageable and reusable. This is where **modules** and **packages** come in handy.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What are Modules?\n",
        "\n",
        "A **module** is simply a file containing Python code (variables, functions, classes, etc.). The file name is the module name with the `.py` extension. Modules allow you to logically organize your Python code, group related code into a file, and make your code reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you have a file named `my_functions.py` containing a function `greet()`, then `my_functions` is a module.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What are Packages?\n",
        "\n",
        "A **package** is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy. Essentially, a package is a directory containing multiple module files and a special `__init__.py` file (which can be empty). This structure allows for grouping modules into a namespace, preventing name collisions, and making it easier to manage larger projects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of a module as a single book, and a package as a library containing many related books (modules).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why Use Modules and Packages?\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Code Organization:** Breaks down large programs into smaller, manageable, and logical units.\n",
        "*   **Reusability:** Code written in one module can be easily used in other modules or programs.\n",
        "*   **Readability:** Makes code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
        "*   **Namespace Management:** Helps avoid naming conflicts by providing separate namespaces for each module.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How to Import and Use Them (`import` statement)\n",
        "\n",
        "The `import` statement is used to bring modules or specific parts of modules into your current Python script or environment. There are several ways to use it:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Import an entire module:**\n",
        "    This imports the whole module, and you access its contents using `module_name.item_name`.\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    import math\n",
        "    print(math.pi)\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Import specific functions or variables from a module:**\n",
        "    This allows you to import only the necessary parts, and you can use them directly without the `module_name.` prefix.\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    from math import pi, sqrt\n",
        "    print(pi)\n",
        "    print(sqrt(16))\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Import all contents from a module:**\n",
        "    Using `*` imports all public names from the module directly into the current namespace. This is generally discouraged as it can lead to name clashes if multiple modules have items with the same name.\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    from math import *\n",
        "    print(sin(0))\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Import a module with an alias:**\n",
        "    You can give an imported module a shorter or more convenient name using the `as` keyword. This is very common for popular libraries like `numpy` (often imported as `np`) and `pandas` (as `pd`).\n",
        "    ```python\n",
        "    import random as rnd\n",
        "    print(rnd.randint(1, 10))\n",
        "    ```\n",

        "*   The tutorial successfully introduced Python's fundamentals and the Google Colab environment, starting with a \"Hello, World!\" program and explaining Colab's interactive cells.\n",
        "*   Core Python concepts were comprehensively covered:\n",
        "    *   **Variables and Data Types:** Demonstrated assignment, type checking with `type()`, and basic operations for `int`, `float`, `str`, and `bool`.\n",
        "    *   **Operators:** Illustrated arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`), comparison (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`), and logical (`and`, `or`, `not`) operators through practical examples.\n",
        "    *   **Control Flow:** Explained and demonstrated `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for conditional execution, and `for` and `while` loops for iterative tasks (e.g., counting, summing, iterating over sequences).\n",
        "*   Key Python data structures were thoroughly explained and demonstrated:\n",
        "    *   **Lists and Tuples:** Highlighted their ordered nature and the crucial difference in mutability. Operations like creation, element access, modification (lists), removal (lists), and iteration were shown, with an explicit demonstration of tuple immutability.\n",
